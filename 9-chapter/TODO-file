Solution to the xml parsing:

The object data in the .xml files can be simple put in a lisp LIST
and all the hassle of parsing the file for special case tags such as:
<attribute ..> then  <vao ..> (Ship.xml)

There isn't much to it:
- position data
- index
- type
- size

then this vertex data must be assiciated with the needed drawing command:
tri-fan, tri-strip or simply triangle

This would make for a readable data-structure; also would be easier to
debug. The current problem involves the use of new tags especially <vao>.
