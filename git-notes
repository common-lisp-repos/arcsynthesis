to "synchronize" git repositories with Magit:

F C-u F -> origin -> master

Overview -----------------------------------------------------------------------


> git init ==> initiallize current directory to be a git repository or reinitialize

> git branch  ==> current branch + all branches
> git branch <name> ==> create branch <name>
> git checkout <name> ==> make branch <name> current
> git merge <branch-name> ==> merge <branch-name> with current branch


# create github repo then make current .git system conscious of it:
git remote add origin https://github.com/k-stz/arcsythesis.git #TODO: really called "*.git" ?

# the above created a remote "origin" which is like a bookmark pointing to a webadress
# TODO: only for web usgae, right?

git remote ==> list available remotes

git push -u origin master ==> push your current branch to the remote origin, ON the BRANCH master

git clone https.//github.com/k-stz/arcsynthesis ==> get a copy of the repository
